People didn't quite understand what was going on but tended to keep all their limbs below the knee covered, just in case. In [K]1026[K] he even cut off the feet of all the vatican statues, challenging papal sculptors to find new creative ways to design standing statues without feet. This resulted in the invention of 'busts sculpture'\",

		\"DLC01S02I01L11\":\"...Uh?\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L12\":\"Well, most of the time, possessions happen through spiritual infection. The demon must have been relatively close if he managed to possess him.\",

		\"DLC01S02D02L02\":\"Me? Since the day I was born. But I've lived mostly within the walls of this castle. I've spent my adult life studying the occult.\",

		\"DLC01S02D02L04\":\"I saw 'The Exorcist' movie 47 times.\",

		\"DLC01S02D02L11\":\"You flatter me, but... What are the 'unique phenomena' you mentioned in your letter? What kind of relationship do you have with the rest of the town?\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L12\":\"Well, I never really managed to fit into the social side of things, but lately it's become impossible.\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L13\":\"What do you mean?\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L14\":\"Not so long ago I was just 'the weird guy', but nobody really picked on me. Some actually even cared for me.\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L15\":\"But then things started to change...\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L16\":\"Suddenly my quirks weren't funny anymore. Instead of arousing curiosity, they started to make people furious!\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L17\":\"Why is that?\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L18\":\"I'm not sure... Since the Technocore was built, everybody got so serious and... started talking only about technology... They started treating me like a freak...\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L19\":\"[h] Understandable. [h]\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L20\":\"Did you ever wish for revenge?\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L21\":\"Me? No, my powers are far too dangerous for these people...\",
