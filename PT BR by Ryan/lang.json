Too bad the guy was already dead, so he made his clerics exhume him, forced some doctor into declaring him alive, and then killed him again in duel. With a cannon. His rotting body was paraded around the city and eventually, after [K]15[K] days of asphyxiating stench, the people rioted and threw the body in the Tevere river.\",

People didn't quite understand what was going on but tended to keep all their limbs below the knee covered, just in case. In [K]1026[K] he even cut off the feet of all the vatican statues, challenging papal sculptors to find new creative ways to design standing statues without feet. This resulted in the invention of 'busts sculpture'\",

		\"DLC01S01D02L08\":\"[s]Hahahaha![s] The Count is an eccentric man. If I knew he was serious when talking about contacting a 'real exorcist', I would have taken matters into my own hands. I'm sorry he bothered you.\",

		\"DLC01S01D06L01\":\"I still haven't found anybody who knows where to find Professor Galilei and this... Count Cardula.\",

		\"DLC01S01D03L05\":\"In the letter, the Count mentioned 'strange events' in town. Do you know anything about it?\",
		\"DLC01S01D03L06\":\"Well, this town is anything but normal. Its technological growth in the last 20 years has been unprecedented. Here, we are far from religious, and we're not interested in your battles. They are foreign concepts, at home only in the great Rome. By the way, how's it going over there? You're living under a... what's the word...? A clerical dictatorship, right?\",
		\"DLC01S01D03L07\":\"Not officially... but yes.\",
		\"DLC01S01D03L08\":\"To answer your question, since I built the Technocore with the citizens of Castel di Vania, life is definitely more 'peculiar' here. But it has nothing to do with the... creatures you go looking for.\",
		\"DLC01S01D03L09\":\"You mean the monument in the plaza, right?\",
		\"DLC01S01D03L10\":\"Exactly. Thanks to a collective effort, the town built the most powerful and green generator in the whole world. Ever since then, our only faith is science. Moreover... here, your superstitions never really took root. Your gods and your pantheon of angels and demons are just a fairy tale to us.\",
		\"DLC01S01D03L11\":\"I don't know about angels, but I can assure you that demons are real. I've risked my life several times fighting them.\",
		\"DLC01S01D03L12\":\"Of course, of course, I don't question it. Every man has to face the demons that...\",
		\"DLC01S01D03L13\":\"What's that racket?\",
		\"DLC01S01D03L14\":\"I have no idea. It's coming from the plaza... It sounds like people arguing.\",

		\"DLC01S01D04L05\":\"Stop messing with our generator and go back to your castle!\",
		\"DLC01S01D04L06\":\"We just want to live in peace and prosperity, marching towards the future! You are the only one left who thinks about zombies, vampires, and aliens!\",
		\"DLC01S01D04L07\":\"But, my dear, you look so pale! Since the library closed down, you don't look so hot... Aren't you sad about losing your job? Don't you miss your books?\",
		\"DLC01S01D04L08\":\"Yes! I mean, no! [S]Aarghhh![S]\",
		\"DLC01S01D04L09\":\"Who am I to stand in the way of progress? This society has no more room for printed paper! I'd rather spend my days keeping watch over the Technocore!\",

		\"DLC01S01D04L16\":\"[s]Exorcist?[s] Hahaha I can't believe it! I read about you guys in some cheap novel. You're literally a cross between a wizard and a priest. Why did you come here? To bring an enchanted sword to the hero? To seal the gates of Hell? Hahahahaha!\",
		\"DLC01S01D04L17\":\"Hey, buddy, we also have our books! Like the Bible, the Gospel, and... other masterpieces I can't recall right now... If you want, I can write those down for you...\",
		\"DLC01S01D04L18\":\"Huh? Are you teasing me?\",

		\"DLC01S02I01L04\":\"Professor Galilei... I regret to inform you that I just identified a case of demonic possession in town.\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L05\":\"I then saw fit to exorcise it, with success.\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L06\":\"Demonic possession? How can that be? It's been years since...\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L07\":\"Some demon might have found fertile ground in the minds of the citizens and...\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L08\":\"I'm shocked... This might be the beginning of an outbreak! It would be outrageous for Castel di Vania! How many people were there?\",

		\"DLC01S02I01L10\":\"Count Cardula...\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L11\":\"...Uh?\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L12\":\"Well, most of the time, possessions happen through spiritual infection. The demon must have been relatively close if he managed to possess him.\",

		\"DLC01S02I01L14\":\"...\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L15\":\"I need to speak with the Count. Tonight, I'll have dinner at [K]his castle[K].\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L16\":\"!!!\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L17\":\"That can't be right! Surely, you don't think the Count might...\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L18\":\"Listen, Professor Galilei. You have a demon problem, and my job, believe it or not, is to fry demons.\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L19\":\"...\",
		\"DLC01S02I01L20\":\"If that's the case... I suppose it's the only thing to do.\",

		\"DLC01S02I02L01\":\"Some people gathered in the street...\",
		\"DLC01S02I02L02\":\"Have you heard? It looks like the exorcist almost blew someone up! Do you think he used... his demonic powers?\",
		\"DLC01S02I02L03\":\"Don't be silly. It's probably some kind of trick, like dynamite or hand grenades.\",
		\"DLC01S02I02L04\":\"Hand grenades?\",
		\"DLC01S02I02L05\":\"Come to think of it, it would be awesome if the standard equipment for exorcists included explosives... But what can you do? We'll just have to keep dreaming...\",
		\"DLC01S02D01L01\":\"Excellent, I managed to avoid that crowd by taking the alleys...\",

		\"DLC01S02D02L01\":\"How long have you been living in this town, Count?\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L02\":\"Me? Since the day I was born. But I've lived mostly within the walls of this castle. I've spent my adult life studying the occult.\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L03\":\"The occult, you say? And what did your studies entail, exactly?\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L04\":\"I saw 'The Exorcist' movie 47 times.\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L05\":\"Never heard of it.\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L06\":\"I also know all the masterpieces of horror cinema by heart, then I delved deeper into the topic with zombie comics and footage of alien sightings.\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L07\":\"[h]I can't figure out if the Count is possessed... I'm not sensing anything, but I won't let my guard down.[h]\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L08\":\"I see. I'm sure your fellow countryman must admire your fine mind...\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L09\":\"Let me ask you a question, Count. Why exactly did you summon me here?\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L10\":\"Meeting you was my dream! You are the greatest rockstar of the HOLY CHURCH! After that famous guy with the long hair, of course...\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L11\":\"You flatter me, but... What are the 'unique phenomena' you mentioned in your letter? What kind of relationship do you have with the rest of the town?\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L12\":\"Well, I never really managed to fit into the social side of things, but lately it's become impossible.\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L13\":\"What do you mean?\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L14\":\"Not so long ago I was just 'the weird guy', but nobody really picked on me. Some actually even cared for me.\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L15\":\"But then things started to change...\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L16\":\"Suddenly my quirks weren't funny anymore. Instead of arousing curiosity, they started to make people furious!\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L17\":\"Why is that?\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L18\":\"I'm not sure... Since the Technocore was built, everybody got so serious and... started talking only about technology... They started treating me like a freak...\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L19\":\"[h] Understandable. [h]\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L20\":\"Did you ever wish for revenge?\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L21\":\"Me? No, my powers are far too dangerous for these people...\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L22\":\"Let me get this straight, Count: what powers are we talking about?\",
		\"DLC01S02D02L23\":\"I can show you a demonic ritual! It's not my first time, so I know my stuff, rest assured.\",
